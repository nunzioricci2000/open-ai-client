# open-ai-client

This app is the result of an informal challenge given to me by an Apple Academy mentor. The app is a simple client for using the API provided by OpenAI. Ninety percent of the code was written in one weekend so I am quite satisfied with the result achieved. This project helped me learn more about the stock components of SwiftUI(due to lack of time), and master data handling, and introduce me to the amazing world of next-generation artificial intelligence. The library used to receive information from the OpenAI API is a fork of mine from adamrushy/OpenAISwift that you can find at https://github.com/nunzioricci2000/OpenAISwift
